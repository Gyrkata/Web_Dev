# Web_Dev CW2

The project didn't really go with the development plans due to time constraints. I'll be away from home and can't keep working on project so uploading as is.
When submitting an entry it gets added to db but gives error which I'm unable to fix. There are two dishes added, models, controllers and routes work.
Don't have a video or testing as app is very unfinished.
Instructions for running:

1. Clone repository: git clone : LINK
2. Install dependencies: npm install
3. node index to run app on port 3000
4. localhost:3000
